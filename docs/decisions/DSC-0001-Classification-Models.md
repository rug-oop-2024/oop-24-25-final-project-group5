# DSC-0001: Implementation of Classification Models
# Date: 2024-10-25
# Decision: Add classification models to the system.
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Expand model options for users to increase choices for data classification. 
# Reason: Added Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-nearest Neighbors to have at least 3 classification models.
# Limitations: These models have limitations, like overfitting for Decision Trees and expensive computability for KNN.
# Alternatives: Other classification models.
