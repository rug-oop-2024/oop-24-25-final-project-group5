# DSC-0003: Add more unit tests.
# Date: 2024-11-08
# Decision: Adds unique unit tests to autoop/tests.
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Testing now covers most of the functionality.
# Reason: More tests would help us see if anything went wrong during development, so we would not push code that does not work.
# Limitations: Cannot simulate our Streamlit app.
